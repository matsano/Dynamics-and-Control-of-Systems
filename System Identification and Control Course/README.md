# System Identification and Control: Algorithm Design
System Identification and Control: Algorithm Design Project

## üìã Description
Project (TP) implemented during the course.

The project consists of a numerical control for the position servo-control of a servomechanism. The project was divided into different parts: modeling the mechanical system, determination of transfer functions, numerical simulations, calculation of speed and position transfer, modeling of the RST corrector and implementation of identification.

## üõ†Ô∏è Software used

This project was implemented in [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and [Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html).

# Dynamics-and-Control-of-Systems
Automatic: Dynamics and Control of Systems Course

## üìã Description
TD and project (TP) implemented during the course.

The project consists of stabilizing a ball that can roll freely on a rotating plate. To achieve this, the project was divided into different parts: modeling the mechanical system based on the Lagrange equation, finding the equilibrium points and the linearized tangent around these points, implementing a controller and an observer and, finally, implementing a controller observer.

## üõ†Ô∏è Software used

This project was implemented in [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and [Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html).

I would like to thank our professors Mr. Thomas Budot and Mr. Nicolas Petit for the knowledge taught in course at [ENSTA Paris](https://www.ensta-paris.fr/) which were essential for the realization of this project.


# System Identification and Control: Algorithm Design
System Identification and Control: Algorithm Design Project

## üìã Description
Project (TP) implemented during the course.

The project consists of a numerical control for the position servo-control of a servomechanism. The project was divided into different parts: modeling the mechanical system, determination of transfer functions, numerical simulations, calculation of speed and position transfer, modeling of the RST corrector and implementation of identification.
